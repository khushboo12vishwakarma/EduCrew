AI is the field of creating machines that can simulate human intelligence, using algorithms and data to perform tasks like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. It relies on techniques like machine learning and deep learning to analyze vast datasets, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Key applications are found in healthcare, finance, and retail, among others. 
Definition and core concepts
Definition: The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially computer programs, that can think and behave like humans.
Goal: To enable computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.
Underlying principles: AI systems learn and improve from data. The performance of an AI system is crucial for the quality and quantity of the data it is trained on.
Interdisciplinary field: AI shares borders with mathematics, computer science, philosophy, psychology, and biology. 
How it works
Data-driven: AI techniques are fundamentally based on data, algorithms, and computational power.
Machine Learning (ML): A subfield where systems learn from data without explicit programming.
Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models.
Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in unlabeled data.
Reinforcement Learning: An agent learns by receiving rewards or punishments for its actions.
Deep Learning: A type of machine learning that uses a network of artificial neurons, inspired by the structure of the human brain. 
Types of AI
Narrow/Weak AI: Can perform specific tasks, like voice assistants or image recognition.
General AI: A hypothetical type that could perform any intellectual task a human can.
Super AI: A hypothetical type that would outperform humans in all aspects. 
Applications
Healthcare: Analyzing medical images for early diagnosis, personalizing treatment plans.
Finance: Detecting fraud by analyzing vast amounts of financial data.
Retail: Personalizing customer experiences through product recommendations and optimizing inventory management.
Customer Service: Using chatbots to handle inquiries and provide 24/7 support.
Autonomous Vehicles: Enabling self-driving cars to perceive their environment and navigate.
Computer Vision: Enabling machines to interpret and "see" the visual world through


 images and videos.
